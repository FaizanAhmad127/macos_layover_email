# Progress

## Architecture
Clean Architecture with Bloc/Cubit:
- `core/errors/` — Failure hierarchy (NetworkFailure, StorageFailure, CredentialFailure)
- `domain/` — pure Dart: Email + Credentials entities, repository interfaces, 4 use cases
- `data/` — EmailModel/CredentialsModel, ImapDataSource, CredentialDataSource, repository impls
- `presentation/cubits/` — EmailMonitorCubit (sealed states) + CredentialsCubit (sealed states)
- `injection/` — GetIt dependency injection container
SOLID: DI via constructor injection, abstractions for all data sources + repositories, single-responsibility per class

## Completed
- Flutter project initialized (Flutter 3.44.1, macOS only)
- Entitlements: network client + keychain (Debug + Release)
- Info.plist: LSUIElement = true (no Dock icon, background agent)
- .gitignore: secrets + macOS build artifacts excluded
- VS Code: format-on-save, Dart formatter, removed FVM SDK path
- Git repo initialized, initial commit on `main`
- GitHub MCP configured in ~/.claude/mcp.json
- Packages added: `window_manager ^0.3.9`, `flutter_secure_storage ^9.2.4`, `enough_mail ^2.1.7`, `flutter_bloc ^8.1`, `equatable ^2.0.5`, `get_it ^7.6`
- `MainFlutterWindow.swift` updated for window_manager (hiddenWindowAtLaunch)
- Refactored to clean architecture + Bloc/Cubit (deleted old lib/services/)
- `EmailMonitorCubit` — sealed states: Initial, Connecting, Listening, NewEmail, CredentialsMissing, Error
- `CredentialsCubit` — sealed states: Initial, Loaded, Missing, Saved, Cleared, Error
- GetIt DI wires all layers; `main.dart` is now a pure StatelessWidget

## Tests — 33/33 passing ✅
- `test/domain/usecases/` — 9/9: LoadCredentials, SaveCredentials, ClearCredentials, WatchNewEmails
- `test/data/repositories/` — 10/10: CredentialRepositoryImpl, EmailRepositoryImpl
- `test/presentation/cubits/` — 14/14: EmailMonitorCubit, CredentialsCubit
- Going forward: tests written before each commit for every new feature

## Current state
Background agent with full clean architecture and passing test suite. EmailMonitorCubit starts on launch, connects to Gmail IMAP IDLE, emits EmailMonitorNewEmail state when mail arrives. Debug prints subject to console. No banner UI yet.

## Next
1. Overlay banner widget (pink waving flag + subject text, slide-in left→right animation)
2. Wire `EmailMonitorNewEmail` state → show banner window via window_manager
3. Settings UI for Gmail credentials entry (email + app password → saved to Keychain)
